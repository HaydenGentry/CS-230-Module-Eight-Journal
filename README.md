Gaming Room Software Design

Our client, The Gaming Room, are developers of a web-based game. They consulted our company on expanding their web-based game to other platforms. Currently their game is only avaliable on Android platforms.

Two of the things I am most proud of documenting were the design constraints and the evaluation. I made sure to clearly and throughly list all of the design constraints for the application. For the evaluation, I conducted a lot of research and gave honest evaluations for all of the operating platorms including their advantages, disadvantages, costs, time, and a brief description.

The process of designing the UML diagram was very helpful when developing the code. The UML diagram illustrates the relationships between classes, including the variables and methods of each of the classes.

One thing that I would improve upon for this document is the domain model explanation. While the explanation I gave is thorough and correct, I could revise the document to make this section easier to read for others.

My interpertation of the users needs was derived from thinking about what the user wants from their gaming experience. The game design and the games performance has a big impact on the user experience, I encorporated these needs into the design constraints section.

When I develop software, my approach is to start with the essiential functions and build out the auxillary functions, testing every step of the way. Something I would do differently in the future is spend more time evaluating the different options to chose from, as it could save a lot of time down the road when developing the software.
